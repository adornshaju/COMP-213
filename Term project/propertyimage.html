<p>A typical 3-bedroom house features three separate bedrooms, with a master bedroom often 
    including an attached bathroom. There are at least two bathrooms in total, including 
    one for general use. The living room serves as a central area for relaxation and entertainment,
     with space for sofas and other furnishings. The kitchen is fully equipped, with room for appliances
      and ample storage. A designated dining area, utility room for laundry, and additional storage 
      spaces like closets contribute to the practicality of the house. Some houses include a garage 
      or designated parking area. Outdoor spaces encompass front and back yards, with potential for
       landscaping, gardens, and a patio or deck. Architectural styles can vary, influencing features 
       such as windows, doors, and flooring. The size and layout range from 1,000 to 2,500 square feet
        or more, with options for single-story or multi-story designs, providing a well-rounded and
         functional living space for residents.</p>
