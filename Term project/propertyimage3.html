<p>A typical 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom house encompasses four separate bedrooms, 
    each offering space for a bed and additional furnishings. The master bedroom 
    often includes an attached bathroom for added privacy and convenience. In total,
     the house features four bathrooms, ensuring ample facilities for residents and guests. 
     The central living room serves as a communal space for relaxation and entertainment, 
     with enough room for sofas and other furniture. The fully-equipped kitchen is designed 
     to accommodate essential appliances and provides sufficient storage with cabinets and pantry 
     space. A designated dining area offers space for meals and gatherings. Additional utility spaces,
      such as a laundry room, contribute to functional living. The house may include storage solutions
       like closets, both in bedrooms and hallways. Outdoor spaces, such as front and back yards or 
       a patio, provide opportunities for outdoor activities. Architectural details, including windows,
        doors, and flooring, contribute to the overall design. With a size typically ranging from 1,500 to 
        3,000 square feet or more, these houses offer a spacious and comfortable living environment suitable
         for larger families or those desiring additional space.</p>
