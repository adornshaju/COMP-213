"I want to give a big shout-out to Mr. Andrea for finding me the perfect 
tiny house in Alexandria. I know it wasn't his usual practice area, 
but he was willing to drive there for a showing and we closed that 
day! I was very picky with what I wanted, because I am an eco-lover, 
so I needed a tiny house that was off the grid completely.
 Mr. Andrea knew just the location to look for, and he found a 
 seller that just renovated their water filtration system.
  I couldn't be happier." - Gabriella Nunes<br><br>
"Steve helped our family find our first home in Canada after 
we immigrated from Nepal. We were looking for a house that 
had enough frooms for our children, and wanted to be close 
to the train station. Steve helped us find a house in Brampton 
that was near a supermarket, bus stops, and was in a quiet 
neighbourhood close to a school. He helped us negotiate the 
offer within our price range, and helped with the paperwork 
involved to buy a house in Canada. I am happy to live here thanks to Steve." - Kiran Pandey<br><br>
"Thank you to Royal Lepage for assigning Steve Andrea to be my listing agent.
 I was able to sell my house smoothly because the agent was very professional. 
 He scheduled the guests for open houses in advance and made sure the property
  was spotless when he came and left. My favourite part of the experience was 
  having dinner with Steve after we sold the house together, he was a true gentleman." - Amanda Tisdale
